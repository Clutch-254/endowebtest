# Endometriosis Awareness Project

## My Journey Creating This Project

When I first started this endometriosis awareness website project, I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew the basics about the condition, but I quickly realized that to create something truly meaningful, I needed to dive much deeper. The research process was eye-opening and sometimes challenging, but I'm incredibly glad I took the time to understand this condition that affects so many people.

## Research Process

My research journey took me through medical journals, patient forums, and educational websites. I learned about:

- The biological mechanisms of endometriosis
- The wide range of symptoms and how they affect daily life
- The challenges patients face in getting diagnosed (7-10 years on average!)
- Treatment options and their various effects
- The emotional and psychological impact of living with chronic pain

What struck me most was how common yet misunderstood endometriosis is. One in ten women and people assigned female at birth will experience this condition, yet public awareness remains surprisingly low.

## Technical Development

From a technical perspective, this project helped me grow my front-end development skills in several ways:

1. **JavaScript Interactivity**: I implemented several interactive features like:
   - The FAQ accordion system
   - The symptom tracker with local storage integration
   - Smooth scrolling navigation
   - Animated content highlights

2. **Responsive Design**: I wanted the site to be accessible on any device, which pushed me to improve my CSS skills, particularly with:
   - Flexbox layouts
   - CSS Grid for the resource cards
   - Media queries for different screen sizes
   - CSS variables for consistent theming

3. **User Experience**: I focused on creating a compassionate, informative experience by:
   - Using a soothing color palette
   - Ensuring text is readable and well-spaced
   - Creating intuitive navigation
   - Providing actionable next steps through the resource section

## Personal Growth

This project changed me in ways I didn't expect. Beyond improving my technical skills, researching endometriosis gave me a deeper appreciation for what many people in my life might be silently enduring(especially in a country such as mine where minimal research and concern goes into such topics). The statistics around delayed diagnosis and the impact on quality of life were particularly moving.

I found myself becoming passionate about the topic, wanting to make sure the information I presented was not just accurate but also compassionate and helpful. What started as a technical exercise became a project with real meaning.

## Next Steps

While I'm proud of this first version, I see many opportunities to expand this project:

- Add a blog section featuring patient stories
- Develop a more comprehensive symptom tracking tool
- Create a directory of specialists by location
- Implement a community forum for support and discussion
- Add accessibility features to ensure the site is usable by everyone

## Conclusion

Creating this endometriosis awareness website has been more than just a coding projectâ€”it's been an educational journey that's improved both my technical skills and my understanding of an important health issue. I hope this website can serve as a resource for those seeking information and support, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to contribute something meaningful while developing my front-end development skills.

If you're a developer considering a project with educational health content, I highly recommend it. The combination of technical challenge and meaningful impact has been incredibly rewarding.
